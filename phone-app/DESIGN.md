# DreamLayer — Design System

One surface, one rhythm, one motion. This is the contract every screen in the
phone app (and the Mac Brain panel and landing page) follows so the product
reads as a single, calm, tactile thing. When you add a screen, compose it from
the primitives here — don't reinvent spacing, color, or motion locally.

> **North star:** the interface is **Mac OS 8.1 "Platinum," in your hand** — a
> grey pinstripe desktop, light beveled windows, Chicago titles, the brand teal
> for meaning. It matches the landing page and the Mac Brain panel exactly.
> Nothing jumps; everything *arrives*. Every touch answers back.

## 1. Color

Source of truth: [`src/ui/theme/colors.ts`](src/ui/theme/colors.ts).

Two exports. `colors` is the semantic palette every screen reads by token name;
`platinum` carries the raw Mac OS 8.1 materials the chrome is built from (bevel
highlight/shadow, the desktop and title-bar pinstripes, the hard 1px frame).
`haloPalette` is the exact mirror of the glasses
(`halo-lua/display/palette.lua`), kept separate on purpose and used only where
the phone previews the HUD — that preview stays a dark little screen.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `background` | `#B8B8B8` | the Platinum desktop behind every window |
| `surface` | `#DDDDDD` | window / control face (the 3D grey) |
| `surfaceElevated` | `#FFFFFF` | white content wells, inputs, list rows |
| `textPrimary` | `#141414` | ink — titles, answers |
| `textSecondary` | `#4A5054` | secondary ink — captions, supporting copy |
| `accentMemory` | `#0B6B52` | deep brand teal — primary actions, "on" |
| `accentAttention` | `#B3402E` | coral ink — promises, incognito, "look here" |
| `accentSuccess` | `#1E7A3C` | confirmations, live |
| `accentError` | `#B3302A` | destructive, unsigned |
| `borderSubtle` | `#8E8E8E` | bevel-shadow line / hairline frame |
| `statusPaused` | `#6B7A82` | muted / disabled |

**Rules**
- One accent per surface. `accentMemory` is the default; reach for another only
  when it *means* something (attention = a promise; error = destroys data).
- Every accent value is chosen to stay legible as text on light — deep, not
  neon. The neon teal survives only as a chip/LED inside the dark HUD preview.
- Text is only ever `textPrimary` or `textSecondary`. Don't invent greys.
- Raised surfaces wear the bevel (light top-left, shadow bottom-right); pressed
  wells invert it. Windows carry the hard 1px black frame; group boxes don't.
- "On" states take the accent as a border edge (`Card active`), never a fill —
  fills are reserved for the teal default push button.

## 2. Rhythm — spacing & radius

Source of truth: [`src/ui/theme/spacing.ts`](src/ui/theme/spacing.ts).

An **8-point grid** with a 4 half-step. Every margin, gap, and pad is a token —
never a raw number.

```
xs 4 · sm 8 · md 12 · lg 16 · xl 20 · xxl 24 · xxxl 32 · huge 48
```

- **`gutter` (24)** is the single horizontal inset every screen shares. It lives
  in `Screen`; don't add your own horizontal padding on top of it.
- **Radius:** `sm 10` (inputs, tags) · `lg 18` (cards) · `pill 999` (buttons,
  chips). Cards and buttons never share a radius — that's how the eye tells a
  surface from an action.

---

## 3. Typography

Source of truth: [`src/ui/theme/typography.ts`](src/ui/theme/typography.ts).

Two faces, paired exactly as the landing page and Mac panel pair them: **Chicago
(`ChicagoFLF`)** is the Mac OS 8.1 system voice — titles, window/menu chrome;
**Space Grotesk** is the reading face — body, captions, the tracked eyebrow, and
the small tab-strip labels (the way the Mac used Geneva for small labels and
Chicago for titles).

| Style | Face · size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `display` | Chicago 32 | screen titles (`ScreenHeader`'s title bar) |
| `headline` | Chicago 23 | hero answers, big moments |
| `title` | Chicago 17 | card headings, window titles |
| `body` | Space Grotesk 16 | the reading line |
| `caption` | Space Grotesk 13 | meta, hints, timestamps |
| `eyebrow` | Space Grotesk 11, tracked, UPPER | section labels above a title/card |
| `mono` | Menlo 13 | codes, tiers, technical strings |

One title per screen (`display`). Sections are announced by an `eyebrow`, never
a second big title. Chicago is a tall, fixed-weight face — never lean on
`fontWeight` for it. It loads from `assets/fonts/ChicagoFLF.ttf` in
`app/_layout.tsx`.

---

## 4. Motion

Source of truth: [`src/ui/anim.ts`](src/ui/anim.ts) (timings from
[`src/ui/theme/motion.ts`](src/ui/theme/motion.ts)).

Two verbs, both **native-driven** (`useNativeDriver: true`) and **reduce-motion
aware** (they snap to the end state when `motion.reduceMotion`).

- **`useEntrance(delay?, rise?)`** — the Mac OS 8 **zoom open**: a fade +
  scale-up from 94% with a slight rise, so windows GROW in the way a zoom-rect
  opens them. `ScreenHeader`, `Card`, and `EmptyState` use it. Stagger a column
  by passing an increasing `delay` (≈45–60ms per item) — see `memories.tsx`.
- **`usePressScale(to?)`** — a spring scale-down while pressed, baked into
  `Tappable`. Platinum push buttons go further: via `Tappable`'s function
  children they press **IN** — the face goes solid dark, the label flips white,
  and the highlight bevel disappears (the site's `.pbtn:active`).
- **WindowShade** — a titled `Card` rolls up to just its title bar when the bar
  (or its collapse box) is tapped, with a `LayoutAnimation` collapse; a shaded
  window loses its pinstripes, the Platinum cue for "inactive."
- **Boot** — one brief boot moment per cold launch (`app/_layout.tsx`): desktop,
  "Welcome to DreamLayer." panel, an extensions-style progress fill, then a
  zoom-away. Reduce-motion skips it.
- **MenuBar** — the top strip (ring mark → home, Chicago name, live clock) that
  matches the website and Mac panel; rendered by `Screen` on every page.

**The easing curve is `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`** everywhere — a soft,
decelerating "arrive." Don't hand-roll other curves.

**Rules**
- Content *arrives*; it never pops. Anything appearing on mount uses
  `useEntrance` (directly, or via `Card`/`ScreenHeader`).
- Every tappable thing is a `Tappable` (or a component built on it —
  `PrimaryButton`, `PillButton`). No bare `TouchableOpacity` in screens.
- Keep durations in `motion` (`fast 180 · base 240 · slow 400`). If a value
  changes on the HUD, change it here too — the phone breathes with the glasses.

## 5. Primitives

All in [`src/ui/components/`](src/ui/components/). Compose screens from these.

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`Screen`** | The frame: the pinstripe desktop (`CineBackdrop`), safe area, one gutter, scroll or fixed body. Start every screen with it. |
| **`ScreenHeader`** | The title as a Mac OS 8.1 window **title bar** — pinstriped, close/zoom boxes, Chicago title. Optional `eyebrow`, `subtitle`, and a right slot. Rises in on mount. |
| **`Card` / `Section`** | `Card` = a beveled platinum panel (group box); pass `title` to grow a pinstriped window title bar. `active` = accent frame; optional `onPress`; `delay` staggers a column. `Section` = the eyebrow label above a group. |
| **`Pinstripe`** | The crisp SVG title-bar hairline fill, shared by `Card` and `ScreenHeader`. |
| **`Tappable`** | The one touch primitive — spring scale-on-press. Drop-in for `TouchableOpacity`. |
| **`EmptyState`** | A calm halo ring + line + hint. No screen ever renders a blank void. |
| **`StatusPill`** | Live / paused indicator for a header's right slot. |
| **`HaloMirror`** | A phone-side mirror of the card currently on the glasses. |
| **`Connector` set** | `ConnectorCard`, `SwitchRow`, `Bullet`, `PillButton` — the Brain screen's connect-a-thing vocabulary. |
| **`QrScanner`** | The pairing scanner (lazy-loads `expo-camera`; degrades to "paste instead" where no camera). |
| **`PrimaryButton` / `EyebrowLabel`** | The onboarding CTA and the tracked-caps label. |
| **`OnboardingDots` / `HaloPairingRing`** | Onboarding progress and the pairing ring. |
| **HUD previews** | `CardPreview`, `DreamCanvas`, `HorizonPreview` — SVG mirrors of the glasses' renderer, drawn in `haloPalette` as QA truth. |

### A screen, canonically

```tsx
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Screen>
      <ScreenHeader title="Example" eyebrow="Section" right={<StatusPill paused={false} />} />
      <Section label="Group" first />
      <Card delay={0}>…</Card>
      <Card delay={45}>…</Card>
    </Screen>
  );
}
```

## 6. State & data

- **`useBrainStore`** is the single source of truth for the three brain switches
  (phone-vs-Mac-mini, cloud, incognito), glasses pairing, and capture. UI reads
  it with selectors; it persists to `AsyncStorage` and best-effort syncs to a
  paired Mac mini. `useHaloStore` and `useMemoryStore` are thin facets over it.
- **Local-first & honest:** stores ship with enough seed state that no surface is
  ever empty on first run (`useMemoryStore`), but nothing is fabricated as
  "real" — `purgeAll()` clears it, and live data replaces it when a brain is
  paired.
- **Pairing** ([`src/services/pairing.ts`](src/services/pairing.ts)) is a codec
  verified byte-for-byte against the Python `dreamlayer/pairing.py`. One
  `dreamlayer:` code carries the Brain URL, token, and glasses id.

## 7. Principles

1. **Frictionless beats featureful.** One code to pair the trio. One switch per
   idea. The default (phone is the brain, cloud off until you opt in) works
   before any setup.
2. **Nothing pops, everything arrives.** Entrance motion + press feedback are not
   decoration — they're how the app tells you it heard you.
3. **One accent per surface.** Color is meaning, not garnish.
4. **Privacy is visible.** Incognito and capture-pause are one tap and always in
   reach; "off" states read unmistakably muted.
5. **The phone breathes with the glasses.** Timings and the HUD palette are
   mirrored, not re-invented — the two screens are one product.

## 8. Android notes

One codebase, one design. Android renders the same Platinum, and the handful
of deliberate per-platform seams are all here — if you add one, add it to this
list and give it a test in `platform_parity.test.ts` / `android_feel.test.ts`.

- **Hard shadows** ([`src/ui/theme/shadow.ts`](src/ui/theme/shadow.ts)):
  `shadow*` is iOS-only and `elevation` draws a soft Material blob — wrong for
  a crisp Mac OS 8.1 offset. `hardShadow()`/`softShadow()` keep the shipped
  `shadow*` on iOS and draw the identical geometry on Android with `boxShadow`
  (new-architecture native, RN ≥ 0.76). Never reach for `elevation` for looks.
- **Juno's glow** ([`Juno.tsx`](src/ui/components/Juno.tsx)): iOS uses a layer
  shadow that hugs her alpha; Android gets a state-tinted SVG radial bloom in
  the same floating view. Same light, different brush.
- **Safe areas**: always `react-native-safe-area-context` — RN's `SafeAreaView`
  is deprecated and a no-op on Android, where the app is edge-to-edge (SDK 57).
  The tab strip sizes itself from the reported bottom inset via
  [`tabBarMetrics`](src/ui/theme/tabBar.ts) (gesture pill vs 3-button nav);
  iOS keeps the fixed 90/30.
- **Type metrics**: the whole scale sets `includeFontPadding: false` (a no-op
  on iOS) so Android measures lines the way iOS does and Chicago sits correctly
  in its line box.
- **Haptics** ([`haptics.ts`](src/services/haptics.ts)): Android speaks the
  notify beats as composed predefined clicks (its `notificationAsync` is a long
  waveform buzz — the pocket pager the vocabulary forbids). The grammar,
  patterns, and pack overrides are shared.
- **Earcons** ([`sound.ts`](src/services/sound.ts)): Android takes *ducking*
  audio focus once at load — music dips under a cue instead of pausing.
- **No blur, anywhere**: Platinum chrome is opaque bevels + pinstripes by
  design, so Android's approximate `expo-blur` never comes up (the dependency
  is gone).
- **Back**: hardware/gesture back pops the router history (drill-ins return to
  the tab you came from; tab roots exit); both modals close via
  `onRequestClose`. Predictive back stays **off** deliberately: the JS tab
  navigator can't drive the preview, so the system would show a misleading
  app-exit zoom on every in-app back.
- **Networking**: Android blocks cleartext HTTP; the phone↔Brain LAN link is
  re-enabled by a *scoped* policy — `plugins/withAndroidLanCleartext.js` (the
  platform half) + `cleartextAllowed()` in
  [`pairing.ts`](src/services/pairing.ts) (the range check Android XML can't
  express). CI fails if the manifest ever gains the blanket flag, an
  un-allowlisted permission, or backups (`scripts/audit-android-permissions.mjs`).
- **Notification channels** ([`notify.ts`](src/services/notify.ts)): two, named
  from existing catalog keys (`now.morningBrief`, `tabs.messages`) so system
  settings read like DreamLayer in all 9 locales; the brief is default
  importance, messages high. Small icon + teal accent come from `app.json`.
